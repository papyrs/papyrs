    </ul>

    <p>
      In order for you to create an account on Papyrs and use our Services, we need to collect and
      process certain information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>

        “User Personal Information.”
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Disclosure</h2>

    <p>
      We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for
      commercial purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how
      our users, collectively, use Papyrs. For example, we may share information pertaining to the
      popularity of different category of blog posts.
    </p>

    <h2>Third Party Vendors</h2>

    <h3>Data Storage</h3>

    <p>
      Papyrs uses third-party vendors and hosting partners for hardware, software, networking,
      storage, and related technology we need to run Papyrs. By using Papyrs Services, you authorize
      Papyrs to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country
      where we operate. All service providers and third-party vendors are required to meet our data
      protection standards.
    </p>

    <h3>Site monitoring</h3>

    <p>
      Papyrs uses a variety of third-party services to diagnose errors and improve the performance
      of our site. We aim to minimize the amount of personal information shared, but the information
      may include your IP address or other identifying information. All service providers and
      third-party vendors are required to meet our data protection standards.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-Party Embeds</h3>

    <p>
      Some of the content that you see displayed on Papyrs is not hosted by Papyrs. These “embeds”
      are hosted by a third-party and embedded in Papyrs. For example: Unsplash images, Giphy GIFs
      or Twitter tweets. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that
      site directly. Papyrs does not control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or
      what they will do with it. Third-party embeds on Papyrs are not covered by this privacy
      policy; they are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service. Be mindful when
      interacting with these services.
    </p>

    <h3>Tracking & Cookies</h3>

    <p>
      We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you return to our
      Services. Third-party vendors may also use cookies for various reasons.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>

    <p>
      We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no
      data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use
      the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure
      your account.
    </p>

    <h3>Administrative Emails from Papyrs</h3>

    <p>
      Sometimes we’ll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can’t
      opt out of this type of “transactional” email (unless you delete your account).
    </p>

    <p>
      When you interact with a transactional email sent from Papyrs (such as opening an email or
      clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Non-administrative Emails from Papyrs</h3>

    <p>
      If you decide to subscribe to Papyrs newsletter, your email address and user profile
      information may be stored by a third-party email provider such as MailChimp or Sendgrid.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you interact with a non-administrative email sent from Papyrs (such as opening an email
      or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that
      interaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Deleting Your Personal Information</h3>

    <p>You may delete your personal information and account at any time.</p>

    <p>
      We do not maintain residual copies of your data even for a brief time period. If you delete
      your account, your information and content will be unrecoverable deleted.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Portability</h3>

      If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such
      that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy,
      we’ll notify you in advance of any such change.
    </p>

    <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>

    <p>
      We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time. If we change this Privacy
      Policy in the future, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the “Effective Date,”
