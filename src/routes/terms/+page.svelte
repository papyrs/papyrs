    <p>
      All uses of the Papyrs logo, Papyrs badges, brand slogans, iconography, and the like, may only

    </p>

    <h2>10. Reserved Names</h2>

    <p>
      Papyrs has the right to maintain a list of reserved names which will not be made publicly
      available. These reserved names may be set aside for purposes of proactive trademark
      protection, avoiding user confusion, security measures, or any other reason (or no reason).
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, Papyrs reserves the right to change any already-claimed name at its sole
      discretion. In such cases, Papyrs will make reasonable effort to find a suitable alternative
      and assist with any transition-related concerns.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Content Policy</h2>

    <p>
      Users must make a good-faith effort to share content that is on-topic, of high-quality, and is
      not designed primarily for the purposes of promotion or creating backlinks. Additionally,
      posts must contain substantial content — they may not merely reference an external link that
      contains the full post. This policy applies to comments, articles, and and all other works
      shared on the Papyrs platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Papyrs reserves the right to remove any content that it deems to be in violation of this
      policy at its sole discretion. Additionally, Papyrs reserves the right to restrict any user’s
      ability to participate on the platform at its sole discretion.
