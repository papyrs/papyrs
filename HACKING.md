# Hacking

This document explains how to run locally the application - i.e. this web editor for blog post - and provide some information if you wish to query the published blog posts.

## Run locally

Following steps are those needed to run locally the dapp and infrastructure of Papyrs. 

### Prerequisite

Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS recommended).

### Clone the repo

First thing first, you need a local copy of the repo. Either clone the repo or a fork and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/papyrs/papyrs
cd papyrs
npm ci
```

### Run locally with offline persistence only

If you are not looking to test or develop any features that require the IC, you can start the local dev server.

```
npm run dev
```

Once started, open the application in your browser [http://localhost:3000].

Note: as no cloud will be connected, the editor will display an error in a toast. It can be ignored.

### Run locally with a simulated "cloud"

If you wish to run the full platform locally, several more steps will be required.

#### Prerequisite

Make sure you have the [Internet Computer SDK](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/introduction/welcome.html#for-first-timers).

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"
```

Once installed, start a local simulated Internet Computer:

```
dfx start
```

#### Clone and run locally our backend and providers

Our backend canisters need to be deployed locally and the related providers need to run as well.

```
git clone https://github.com/papyrs/ic
cd ic
npm ci
dfx deploy manager
dfx deploy --argument 'secret' feed
npm run start --workspace=providers/ic
```

In addition, you will also need to deploy [Internet Identity](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/) locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity
cd internet-identity/demos/using-dev-build
npm ci
dfx deploy --no-wallet --argument '(null)'
```

You might get different canister ids for the "manager", "feed" and the Internet Identity canisters than the default ones configured in the app. Find the actual IDs in related `.dfx/local/canister_ids.json` of each project and adjust it accordingly in the `.env.development` configuration file of the app (keys `VITE_IC_MANAGER_CANISTER_ID`, `VITE_IC_FEED_CANISTER_ID` and `VITE_IC_LOCAL_IDENTITY_CANISTER_ID`).

#### Run application

As with the offline persistence, once everything deployed and configured, the application can be run locally.

```
npm run dev
```

## Query blog posts

Users can optionally submit their articles to Papyrs to promote these on our various social channels (Twitter, Discord, etc.) and to make these available to any developers through our "Feed" canister smart contract.

Here are the few information you need to know if you wish to query our smart contract that make the information public.

Please restrain to SPAM and query to often the canisters as it is shared among the community.

- The feed canister ID is `undmj-fiaaa-aaaan-qaocq-cai` on mainnet
- Its code is open source - published in our [IC repo](https://github.com/papyrs/ic) - and the `did` files are available in this [folder](https://github.com/papyrs/ic/tree/main/providers/ic/src/canisters/feed)

The smart contract exposes one public function `list`. e.g. using [dfx] is can be queried as following. 

```bash
dfx canister --network ic call "undmj-fiaaa-aaaan-qaocq-cai" list
```

The function has an optional filter parameter that can be used to select a subset of entries. Notably a `storageId` (of type `Principal`).

e.g. David's blog URL is `https://6zvwc-sqaaa-aaaal-aalma-cai.raw.ic0.app/` so `6zvwc-sqaaa-aaaal-aalma-cai` can be used to select only David's blog posts.
